<h2>Description</h2>
This project involved evaluating multiple methods to extract key values from PDFs with highly inconsistent formatting. I compared Microsoft Power Automate’s AI Builder against a custom Python script to determine which approach produced more reliable results for downstream automation. 
<br />

<h2>Languages and Utilities Used</h2>

- Microsoft Power Automate AI Builder (form processing model)
- Python (PDF parsing with pdfplumber, re, and PyMuPDF)
- Manual validation logs
- Accuracy scoring and comparison framework

<h2>Environments Used </h2>

- Windows 11

<h2>Contributions </h2>

- Built and trained an AI Builder model on sample invoices and forms
- Developed a Python script to extract similar fields using regex and layout analysis
- Created a benchmarking process to compare field accuracy and extraction time
- Recommended tool based on success rate, maintainability, and processing speed

<h2>✅ Outcome</h2>

- Identified the most efficient tool for extracting structured fields
    -   The custom script was more accurate and loaded quicker, but the AI builder integrated into platforms like Power Automate much more easily. 
- Enabled smoother data flows from PDFs into reports and financial systems
- Created a framework that could be reused for future OCR/AI analysis
